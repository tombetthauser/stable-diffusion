# Stable Diffusion üê¥‚ú®

Output from collaborative experiments with visual artists. Also notes taken while working through an intro to machine learning course.

## Image Set One

Collaboration with a visual artist using fine-tuning to train stable diffusion model to recognize and emulate the style of the artist. Fine-tuning training was only given a six examples of the artist's work. The results (thankfully) were not indistinguishable facsimiles of the artist's work but instead seemed to be extremely interesting extensions / explorations / insights into the artist's work.
