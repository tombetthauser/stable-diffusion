## Image Set One...

Collaboration with a visual artist using fine-tuning to train stable diffusion model to recognize and emulate the style of the artist's paintings. Fine-tuning training was only given six examples of the artist's work. 
* [stable diffusion images](/assets/image-set-1/output-images.md)
* [training images](/assets/image-set-1/training-images.md)

The results (thankfully) were not indistinguishable facsimiles of the artist's work but instead seemed to lean towards being compelling extensions / explorations / insights into the artist's work. The artist's impression was extremely positive and indicated that the images were going to play a valuable tool in the artist's studio practice / art production process.
