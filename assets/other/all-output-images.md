# Image Set 1: All Output Images

## Reflections on Prompts and Output Images

All the output images and prompts given to the fine-tuned stable diffusion model trained on images from the first artist. Since this was the first session prompts were a bit scattered, some given by the artist, some given by me in an effort to experiment with the best way to give input. Additionally some prompts were unfortunately not recorded. Using Google Colab Pro each generation set took approximately 5-10 minutes to produce and output sets were limited to 16 by memory constraints from Colab.

In total 20 prompts were given which seemed reasonable as repeating motiffs / some redundancy seemed to become unavoidable. Unclear whether this may be connected to the number and diversity of input training images, which there were 5 of in this case.
[n future sessions a set of control prompts should be given (ie "an astronaut riding a horse in the style of &lt;artist&gt;"]

---along with a set of prompts directly from the artist. Additionally prompts should be recorded in advance and if possible run in an automated queue, saving prompts as image file names automatically. The creation of a directory structure and markdown files should also be automated.

Regardless of the small number of training images and scattered prompts the first session overwhelmingly felt like a success. The images generated seemed to constitute unique insights into the artists work without feeling like rote facsimilies or replacements for the original work. They did not seem to be attempting to accurately immitate the artist's hand and largely ignored the most unique aspects of the artist's work but seemed instead to provide the same feedback and idea-generation that would be given in a standard academic critique setting with other visual artists.

Note that in promp text the special term &lt;artist&gt; is used as a stand-in for the artist's name. This is the same kind of syntax that is used when actually prompting the image generation model as a way of signalling that this is a special word that it should connect to the images that we trained it on during fine-tuning.
