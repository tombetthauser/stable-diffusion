# Training Images for Set 1

In this first fine-tuning training session five images of paintings made by the artist were used. This seems to be regarded as an adequate number of input images but experimenting with more or fewer may be of interest in future sessions. These images were selected because they seemed to diversely represent a unifying style, in this case striped patterns interacting with human figures.

There didn't seem to be any indication of problems with this input, but more images may result in more accurate imitations of the artist's style.
